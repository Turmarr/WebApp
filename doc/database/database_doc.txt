#doc for database.js

#general
Defines a connection pool to the database set in the configuration with a
maximum of 4 connections at the same time.

Runs all of the queries in the database.

#executeQuery

The actual function that asks the queries. Returns the return value of the 
query or null. In the case of an error logs it to the console.

#executeCachedQuery

Utilises executeQuery to ask the queries but also caches the queries so, that
if a recurring query is done the time to responde is shorter.

On a query starting with "INSERT" it clears the cache.
