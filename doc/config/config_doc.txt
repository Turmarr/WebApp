#general

Configures the database credentials and the port that
the app listens to.

Database credentials are read from env variables and use normally a .env file.
If there is a env called DATABASE_URL it is used instead of the many smaller
parts.

The port is set to default to 7777 and if in the run call are more arguments it
uses the last of them. Mainly important for deployment to heroku.
