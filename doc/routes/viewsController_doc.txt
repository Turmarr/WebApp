#general

Functions are related to the root page and the summary page.

#main

Displays the root page. Uses getMoodForDay twice to get the mood data for 
today and yesterday.

#getSummary

Displays the summary page.

If in the session 'dates' is set to other than null reads the default values
for the selectors from the session. Otherwise uses last month and week as the
default values. Should take into consideration how the year changes. Year
values are different for month and week.

After reading the dates values sets the session variable 'dates' to null.

Uses functions getWeeklyData and getMonthlyData.

#postSummary

Recieves the week and month data from the selectors and sets in the session
the variable 'dates', into which it transfers the data.

Does not check the validity of the data, as the forms are for months and
weeks. Due to this Mozzilla Firefox is currently not supported as it
does not support month and week input types, instead converts them to text.
It is still possible to use Mozzilla but care has to be taken to input
the data correctly.

After that redirects back to the page.
