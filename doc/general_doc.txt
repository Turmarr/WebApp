#instructions on running the program

after creating the required database tables with the info found in
doc/database/database_creation.txt the information of the database
must be inputted into a .env file with the following statements
    PGPORT=port
    PGDATABASE=database
    PGHOST=host
    PGUSER=user
    PGPASSWORD=password


The app is run from the command line with the following statement:

deno run --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --unstable app.js

#testing

The test are run against my test database and as such the values are off.
In the documentation dedicated to testing is information what it is tested against.

Firstly set a anviromental variable TEST=true.

Second run the following from the command line:

deno test --allow-env --allow-net --allow-read --unstable

after settting the env variable the command window might not be usable for 
normal usage of the app.

Sometimes on the first time the tests are run some fail due to resources not being cleaned up,
but if the tests are run again all pass, at least on my system.

#deployed
